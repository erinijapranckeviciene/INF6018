Work with igraph

 How to read the network data into igraph
 Ref: https://r.igraph.org/reference/read_graph.html
 Example:
 
 	nw<-read_graph(file_name, format=c("pajek"))
 	nw
 	
 The pajek network can be directed with "*Arcs" or undirected "*Edges". 
 Louvain community detection and several other methods do not work with directed network. 
 
 To start laying out the network use layout functions
 Ref: https://r.igraph.org/reference/index.html#visualization
 Example:
 
 	lay<-layout_nicely(nw)

Examples how to draw the network is shown in R scripts. Many thanks to the poster of the answer.
